## About me

My name is Hannan and I am currently studying for an MSc in Computer Science. I have always had a love for technology and decided to take on a conversion Masters course after I finished my undergraduate degree in Chemistry as I knew I wanted to become a software engineer! Recently, I have really enjoyed having a go at Android app development in Java in my spare time alongside my studies.

### Skills

I have learnt the following languages:
- Python
- Java
- C
- Haskell

Additionally, I have experience working with Agile methodologies, particularly Scrum, in a team.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/HannanDotCom/portfolio/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
